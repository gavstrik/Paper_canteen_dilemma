% Once your paper is accepted for publication, 
% PLEASE REMOVE ALL TRACKED CHANGES in this file 
% and leave only the final text of your manuscript. 
% PLOS recommends the use of latexdiff to track changes during review, as this will help to maintain a clean tex file.
% Visit https://www.ctan.org/pkg/latexdiff?lang=en for info or contact us at latex@plos.org.

%
% There are no restrictions on package use within the LaTeX files except that no packages listed in the template may be deleted.

% Please do not include colors or graphics in the text.

% -- FIGURES AND TABLES
%
% Please include tables/figure captions directly after the paragraph where they are first cited in the text.
%
% DO NOT INCLUDE GRAPHICS IN YOUR MANUSCRIPT
% - Figures should be uploaded separately from your manuscript file. 
% - Figures generated using LaTeX should be extracted and removed from the PDF before submission. 
% - Figures containing multiple panels/subfigures must be combined into one image file before submission.
% For figure citations, please use "Fig" instead of "Figure".
% See http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures for PLOS figure guidelines.
%
% Tables should be cell-based and may not contain:
% - spacing/line breaks within cells to alter layout or alignment
% - do not nest tabular environments (no tabular environments within tabular environments)
% - no graphics or colored text (cell background color/shading OK)
% See http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/tables for table guidelines.
%
% For tables that exceed the width of the text column, use the adjustwidth environment as illustrated in the example table in text below.

% -- EQUATIONS, MATH SYMBOLS, SUBSCRIPTS, AND SUPERSCRIPTS
%
% IMPORTANT
% Below are a few tips to help format your equations and other special characters according to our specifications. For more tips to help reduce the possibility of formatting errors during conversion, please see our LaTeX guidelines at http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/latex
%
% For inline equations, please be sure to include all portions of an equation in the math environment.  For example, x$^2$ is incorrect; this should be formatted as $x^2$ (or $\mathrm{x}^2$ if the romanized font is desired).
%
% Do not include text that is not math in the math environment. For example, CO2 should be written as CO\textsubscript{2} instead of CO$_2$.
%
% Please add line breaks to long display equations when possible in order to fit size of the column. 
%
% For inline equations, please do not include punctuation (commas, etc) within the math environment unless this is part of the equation.
%
% When adding superscript or subscripts outside of brackets/braces, please group using {}.  For example, change "[U(D,E,\gamma)]^2" to "{[U(D,E,\gamma)]}^2". 
%
% Do not use \cal for caligraphic font.  Instead, use \mathcal{}

\section*{Abstract}
Common knowledge is crucial for safe group coordination. In its absence, %When common knowledge cannot be obtained, 
humans must %are forced to 
rely on shared knowledge, %only.
which is inherently limited in depth and therefore prone to coordination failures,
%humans rely on their ability to identify shared knowledge to distinguish who knows what.
%When common knowledge can not be obtained, humans routinely use their ability to attribute beliefs and intentions \tobo{What does intentions have to do with it? Next sentence also says "*such* shared knowledge attributions", which in principle is neither about beliefs nor intentions.} \tsn {Maybe I misunderstand, but intentions are related due to the fact that coordination relies on being able to correctly attribute (predict) the intentions of others. But I find another issue: It might imply that people *only* attribute beliefs to others when common knowledge cannot be obtained. But every social action involves belief attribution (or attributing some mental state to others). So, could word it as something like "When common knowledge cannot be obtained, humans rely on their ability to identify shared knowledge to distinguish between who knows what" }  in order to infer what is known. 
%But shared knowledge is limited in depth and therefore prone to coordination failures. %
because any finite-order knowledge attribution allows for an even higher order attribution that may change what is known by whom. 
In three separate experiments involving 802 participants, we investigate the extent to which humans %are able to recognize the difference 
can differentiate between common knowledge and $n$th-order shared knowledge. We %have 
designed a two-person coordination game with imperfect information to simplify the %that is able to cast the 
recursive game structure and higher-order uncertainties into a relatable everyday scenario. 
In this game, coordination %to achieve 
for the highest payoff requires a specific fact to be common knowledge between players. 
However, this fact cannot become common knowledge %is impossible to achieve 
in the game. The fact can at most be $n$th-order shared knowledge for some $n$.
%only nth-order shared knowledge can be achieved for varying values of n.
Our findings reveal that even at quite shallow depths of shared knowledge (low values of $n$), players behave as though they possess common knowledge, and %express 
claim similar levels of certainty in their actions, %as if they had. 
despite incurring significant penalties when falsely assuming guaranteed coordination.
We term this phenomenon `the curse of shared knowledge'. It %occurs in spite of participants suffering huge payoff penalties when falsely assuming that coordination, and hence common knowledge, is guaranteed.
  %\tsn{Måske korte lidt ned, eller hive lidt i land? Synes ikke vi konkluderer for stærkt her, udover måske "express certainty", som måske altid er lidt svært at rigtigt vide.} \add{
 % We conjecture that this is 
arises either from the players' %participants' 
inability to distinguish between higher-order shared knowledge and common knowledge, or from their implicit assumption that their co-player cannot make this distinction.
  
%express to be completely certain about being coordinated and achieving the highest payoff,  
% express to be as certain that they are coordinated and will achieve the highest payoff as if they indeed had common knowledge. 
%Despite this, our results show that participants behave as if they had common knowledge, and for sufficiently large values of n, they claim to  
% in self-assessing the certainty of receiving the 
%their actions
%claim their actions to be as certain as if they had common knowledge. 
%It is impossible to achieve common knowl
%
%Our results show that participants have a very hard time accepting the fact that common knowledge is not reducible to shared knowledge.\tobo{Maybe too strong? Do our results really show that? They behave as if having common knowledge, but they might still be able to distinguish common knowledge achieved via public announcements from what they have in this game.} Instead, participants try to coordinate even at quite shallow depths of shared knowledge and in spite of huge payoff penalties. \tsn{With regards to Tobo's comments consider the following alternative: "Our results show that participants try to coordinate when the levels of shared knowledge gets sufficiently high. In other words, our participants behave as if they have common knowledge about facts that are only shared knowledge, and collectively suffer huge payoff penalties as a result."} \re{Yes too strong, i guess. Proposal, taget fra TOBO: "Our results show that participants behave as if they had common knowledge. Participants also claim to be certain about their actions as if they had common knowledge, even when common knowledge is not obtainable."}
