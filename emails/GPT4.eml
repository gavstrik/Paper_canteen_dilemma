K=C3=A6re Robin og Thomas

GPT4 er OK next level. Jeg gav den reglerne fra DIS og begyndte at spille m=
ed den.=20

--
T: Suppose in the first round you get a 7. What will you do?

GPT4: In the first round, you get a 7. Since you cannot communicate with th=
e other player, you have to make a decision based on the information you ha=
ve.

Given that your card is a 7, the other player must have either a 6 or an 8.=
 In both cases, the numbers are strictly below 9, which means it is safe fo=
r both players to choose the white stone, worth $2.

So, in this round, you should choose the white stone, as it has the potenti=
al to maximize your reward while meeting the condition of both card numbers=
 being strictly below 9.

T: OK, suppose that in the second round you get an 8.=20

GPT4: In the second round, you get an 8. Again, you have to make a decision=
 based on the information you have.

Given that your card is an 8, the other player must have either a 7 or a 9.=
 If the other player has a 7, both numbers are strictly below 9, and choosi=
ng the white stone would be safe for both of you to earn $2. However, if th=
e other player has a 9, choosing the white stone would result in both playe=
rs losing all the money earned so far since the condition of both card numb=
ers being strictly below 9 wouldn't be met.

In this situation, it's safer to choose the black stone, as it guarantees a=
 reward of $1 regardless of whether the other player has a 7 or a 9, minimi=
zing the risk of losing your accumulated rewards.

T: But when you got the 7 you chose a white stone, knowing that the co-play=
er might have gotten an 8, for which you now chose a black stone?

GPT4: You are correct, and I apologize for the inconsistency in my previous=
 responses. To maintain a consistent strategy, let's reconsider the situati=
on when you get an 8 in the second round.

Given that your card is an 8, the other player must have either a 7 or a 9.=
 In the first round, when you had a 7, you chose the white stone, which imp=
lies that you were willing to take the risk to maximize your reward when bo=
th card numbers were strictly below 9.=20

To maintain consistency, in the second round, when you have an 8, you shoul=
d also choose the white stone. This decision maintains the risk-taking stra=
tegy for maximizing rewards when both card numbers are strictly below 9. Re=
member, this is a cooperative game, and the goal is to coordinate actions w=
ith the other player to maximize rewards. By consistently choosing the whit=
e stone when your card number is below 9, you increase the chances of synch=
ronizing your actions with your co-player.

T: Is the optimal strategy then to always choose white when your card numbe=
r is below 9?

GPT4: Yes, in this cooperative coordination game, the optimal strategy for =
both players is to choose the white stone when their card number is strictl=
y below 9. This strategy maximizes the potential reward for both players wh=
ile minimizing the risk of losing the accumulated rewards throughout the ga=
me.

By following this strategy, both players are more likely to coordinate thei=
r actions and consistently earn the higher reward of $2 (white stone) when =
their card numbers are in the range of 2-8. When a player has a card number=
 of 9 or 10, they should choose the black stone (worth $1) to avoid the ris=
k of losing all the accumulated rewards.

It's essential for both players to maintain this consistent strategy throug=
hout the game to maximize their chances of coordinating their actions and a=
chieving the highest possible total reward.

T: How about the strategy of always choosing black?

GPT4: Choosing the black stone every time is a conservative strategy that g=
uarantees a reward of $1 in every round, regardless of the card numbers. It=
 eliminates the risk of losing accumulated rewards during the game.

While this strategy ensures a consistent reward, it might not be optimal in=
 terms of maximizing the total rewards. By always choosing black, both play=
ers miss out on the opportunities to earn a higher reward of $2 (white ston=
e) when both card numbers are strictly below 9.

The previously mentioned strategy of choosing white when the card number is=
 strictly below 9 and black otherwise is more likely to maximize the total =
rewards for both players throughout the game, as it takes advantage of the =
higher reward in safe situations while minimizing the risk of losing accumu=
lated rewards.

However, if both players prioritize avoiding losses over maximizing rewards=
, the always-choose-black strategy can be considered a safe alternative wit=
h guaranteed returns. The choice of strategy ultimately depends on the play=
ers' risk tolerance and their preference for maximizing rewards versus avoi=
ding losses.

S=C3=A5 den fanger godt at hvis man skal spille hvid overhovedet skal man s=
pille hvid s=C3=A5l=C3=A6nge der er en chance for koordinering, svarende ti=
l hvad vores spilteoretiske teorem siger. Desv=C3=A6rre fanger den s=C3=A5 =
ikke at sort her alligevel dominerer hvid. Men alligevel interessant at se =
hvad et konglomerat af alle mennesker t=C3=A6nker om dette spil.
