# User Guide
Running our code requires having Jupyter Notebook installed.
To generate the figures shown in our paper, open the Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) in the Jupyter Notebook application and run the entire notebooks from start to bottom.
The .py files clean-up and format our data, and are not necessary to run, since these files are already present in /Data.
