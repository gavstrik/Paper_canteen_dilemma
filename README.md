# User Guide
Running our code requires setting up Jupyter Notebook.
To generate the figures shown in our paper, open the Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) in the Jupyter Notebook web application and run by the entire notebooks from start to bottom.
The .py files clean-up and format our data, and are not necessary to run, since these files are already present in /Data.
